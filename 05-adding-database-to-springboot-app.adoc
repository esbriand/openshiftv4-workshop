= Deploy a Spring Boot Application and add a backend database
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

:data-uri:

In this exercise we will deploy a SpringBoot application and MySQL databasead as a backend data store.

=== Deploy a Spring Boot Application

In this exercise we will deploy a Java application

==== Create Project
IMPORTANT: Please replace *<Username>* with your username

- login to web UI via {{CONSOLE_ADDRESS}}
- Use the same username and password that assigned to you
- Switch to `Developer` persona
- Click onto `Project` on the top
- Click `Create Project`

image::dev-project.png[image]

- Enter *spring-<Username>* as name of the project. The display name and description is optional.

==== Developer Persona

- Click `+Add` on the left menu
- Click onto `From Git`

image::from-git.png[image]

- Enter https://github.com/esbriand/spring-sample-app.git in the `Git Repo URL` field
- Select `Java` in the `Builder image` field

image::build-java.png[image]

- Select `8` in the `Builder Image Version` field
- Enter `bootapp-spring` in the `Application Name` field
- Enter `bootapp` in the `Name` field

The configuration should look as follows.

image::import-from-git.png[image]

- Select `Create` to build an start the application.

IMPORTANT: Please replace *<Username>* with the username assigned to you in
the commands below.

Wait for the build to complete and verify the application is active by trying the following application url.

http://bootapp-spring-<Username>.{{APPS_ADDRESS}}

You should see something similar to the following page.

image::bootapp-result.png[image]

Finally you can verify whether the application data exists by using the `/dbtest` extention as follows.

http://bootapp-spring-<Username>.{{APPS_ADDRESS}}dbtest

You should encounter a SQL exception since there is no backed database configured. 

image::bootapp-sql-exception.png[image]

There is a built in HSQLDB, but the application isn't configured to utilize it.
Let's take a moment to understand how this application is connecting to
the HSQLDB. Look at the `application.properties` file in the code
https://github.com/RedHatWorkshops/spring-sample-app/blob/master/application.properties
and we have configured these spring datasource variables to use hsqldb.

....
spring.datasource.platform=hsqldb
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:hsqldb:file:/opt/app-root/src/mydb;shutdown=true
spring.datasource.username=user
spring.datasource.password=password
....

Of course,
https://github.com/RedHatWorkshops/spring-sample-app/blob/master/pom.xml
has the required dependencies. So springboot is able to create the in
memory database.

Where is the data coming from? See these two files:

* https://github.com/RedHatWorkshops/spring-sample-app/blob/master/src/main/resources/schema-hsqldb.sql
is creating the schema
* https://github.com/RedHatWorkshops/spring-sample-app/blob/master/src/main/resources/data-hsqldb.sql
is adding data. 

This is the data displayed when you invoke dbtest endpoint, but the values in the application.properties 
file hasn't been made available in the container. Let's fix that.

- Select the `Topology` view
- Select the `bootapp` Deployment Configuration and the under `Actions` select `Edit Deployment Config`

image::bootapp-edit-dc.png[image]

- Select the `Environment` tab and add the following environment variables. See above to copy needed values.

image::bootapp-env-dc.png[image]

Once you save the values go back to the Topology view and notice the pod is redeploying due to the change
in the Deployment Configuration.

image::bootapp-redeploy.png[image]

Once the pod is up and running, let's try the dbtest URL again.

http://bootapp-spring-<Username>.{{APPS_ADDRESS}}dbtest

Notice that the data is now displayed.

Let's find out next how to decouple the database from the application.

=== Deploy a MySQL database and Configure the Application

In this lab, we will add a second tier to the application by adding a
MySQL database running as a separate pod.

==== Step 1: Add a MySQL database to this project

Based on what you learnt in the previous labs, you know what to do!!

IMPORTANT: Please replace *<Username>* with the username assigned to you in
the commands below.

Make sure you are in the `spring-<Username>` project where your springboot
application is running. 

- Click `+Add` on the left menu
- Click onto `Database`

image::database.png[image]

select `MySQL Ephemeral` from the catalog and click Initiate Template.

image::mysql.png[image]

When you are deploying this database you will have to choose the following values.

*Database Service Name:* mysql +
*MySQL Connection Username:* user +
*MySQL Connection Password:* password +
*MySQL Database Name:* sampledb +
*Version of MySQL Image:* 8.0

_Feel free to use your own values, but make a note of the values_ (You will need them in step 2)

Click on the `Create` button and within a few min or two your MySQL
database pod should be up and running.

==== Step 2: Configuring database connection params

Let's edit the values in the `bootapp` Deployment Configuration to the values
you noted in the last step i.e.

....
spring.datasource.platform=mysql
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://mysql.spring-userxx:3306/sampledb?useSSL=false
spring.datasource.username=user
spring.datasource.password=password
....

You need to make sure that you substitute the correct values you noted
in the last step when you are creating the service. *Be extra-careful..
read instructions below.*
Specifically note the datasource url. It is in the following format:
`spring.datasource.url = jdbc:<<databasetype>>://<<service-host>>:<<service-port>>/<<dbname>>?useSSL=false`

You can replace `service-host` by the IP address of your MySQL service
or the Service name. In the above example, I am using the service name
for example `mysql.spring-<Username>`. Here `mysql` is the name of the
service and `spring-<Username>` is the project name. This is a fully
qualified way to let your application do service discovery in OpenShift
(it uses SkyDNS).

- Click `Save`

The Configuration Map should be similar to the following.

image::bootapp-mysql-params.png[image]

Go back to the `Developer` persona and select the `Topology` view. When you select
the `bootapp` Deployment Configuration you should see that the pod has been redployed.

image::bootapp-redeploy-again.png[image]

Yes, redeployed, not rebuilt.

==== Step 3: Test your application

Go back to the `Developer` persona. Click Toplogy and your application url which
would be something like
`http://bootapp-spring-<Username>.{{APPS_ADDRESS}}`

It will open a new tab and your running application will greet you similar to below.

`Hello from bootapp-3-rwhjq`

Now move back to your webconsole and watch the pod logs.

Now access the application with the `/dbtest` extension -
`http://bootapp-spring-<Username>.{{APPS_ADDRESS}}dbtest`

It should show the data from your MySQL database.

....
Customers List

CustomerId: 2 Customer Name: Joe Mysql Age: 88
CustomerId: 3 Customer Name: Jack Mysql Age: 54
CustomerId: 4 Customer Name: Ann Mysql Age: 32
....

Where did this data come from? Look at *
https://github.com/RedHatWorkshops/spring-sample-app/blob/master/src/main/resources/schema-mysql.sql
was used to initialize the MySQL database *
https://github.com/RedHatWorkshops/spring-sample-app/blob/master/src/main/resources/data-mysql.sql
was used to populate data. I added 'Mysql' as part of the names to make
it easy ;)

Also note that the `bootapp` pod (bootapp-3-rwhjq) log shows the connection url, just to verify which
database you are connecting to.

....
connection url: jdbc:mysql://mysql.spring-user1:3306/sampledb?useSSL=false
....

==== Bonus Step
Log into the MySQL instance and verify the data in the customer table!!

In this lab exercise, you have learnt how to set up a multi-tiered
application and also to pass configuration information external to the application.
